  *   This is where all of the "OBJECTS" stylesheets are compiled
  *
  *   These are concerned with styling non-cosmetic design patterns, or 'objects'.
  *   Objects can range from something as simple as a .wrapper element, to layout systems, through to things like the OOCSS poster child â€“ the Media Object.
  *   This layer affects less of the DOM than the last layer, has a higher specificity, and is slightly more explicit in that we are now targeting sections of the DOM with classes.
